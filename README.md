# Time-series-forecasting

Producing useful predictive time-series forecasting models is a notoriously difficult domain of AI. Here we explore various time series datasets and attempt to fit a variety of models. The top level findings from all of this are that; yes, time series forecasting is very difficult for certain applications, however it is quite manageable in certain cases and can actually produce models with quite a lot of predictive power. In the former category are examples such as stock prices and web traffic which are very noisey processes with very little in the way of periodicity or trends for the models to learn. In the latter case are examples such as cylical weather patterns over time with clear periodicity at various frequencies which our models are very capable at capturing and producing forecasts that perform much better than baseline 'naive' models do.
